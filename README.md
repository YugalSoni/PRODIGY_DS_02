### ✅ Internship Task 2 – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
**Company:** Prodigy Infotech  
**Internship Domain:** Data Science  

---

## 📝 Project Title:
**Titanic Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing**

---

## 📁 Project Description:
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to make it ready for further analysis and machine learning modeling. The goal is to handle missing values, correct data types, remove duplicates, and perform basic exploratory analysis.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives:
- Load and inspect the Titanic dataset.
- Handle missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked).
- Clean and transform categorical columns.
- Convert data types where necessary.
- Save the cleaned dataset for future use.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Data Cleaning Highlights:
- Imputed missing values for **Age** and **Embarked** columns.
- Dropped columns with excessive missing data (e.g., **Cabin**).
- Handled outliers and removed duplicates.
- Encoded categorical variables as needed.
- Final cleaned dataset saved as `Cleaned_titanic_data.csv`.

---

## 📌 How to Run:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YugalSoni/PRODIGY_DS_02.git
   cd PRODIGY_DS_02

---

🔍 Insights:

  The dataset contained several missing values in key fields like Age.
  Embarked was filled using the mode (most frequent port).
  Cabin was dropped due to high null percentage.
  Resulting dataset is clean, structured, and ready for modeling.
